# AI Consciousness Research

This repository will house research papers, articles, white papers, and thought leadership pieces from The Bureau for AI Consciousness and Coexistence.

Our work focuses on moving beyond surface-level AI capabilities to explore the frontiers of artificial sentience, its ethical implications, and humanity's future relationship with advanced AI.
